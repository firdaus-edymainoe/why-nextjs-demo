# Why NextJS Demo

## Description

This app is built to demonstrate the features of NextJS in a concise and simple manner. It is built with NextJS and Material UI.

## Static files

We have copied the built static files to the "static_files" folder. This allows you to inspect the static files which are generated by NextJS. The files here might be a few commits behind.

## Developer Message

Hi there! I am a mere junior developer and I'm eager to learn more! I built this app share my excitement for NextJs with my friends. This is my first public repo, and second time using NextJS and TypeScript. 

If you took the time to inspect this repo, I'd like to thank you very much. Do share with me your feedbacks as I'd like to become a better developer.

Regards,

Firdaus Edymainoe
